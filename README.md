# Master-thesis
Master thesis, written in Latex, on 'Kinetics of Olivine Dissolution in Column Experiments'. Also contains Tableau workbooks for charts drawn on the data-visualization software *Tableau*.

## Usage
Can serve as a useful template to writing thesis involving chemical equations and laboratory experiments. 

## Description
In January 2017, I submitted my master thesis, as part of the Master program - Integrated Climate System Sciences at the University of Hamburg. My thesis consisted of laboratory experiments conducted for over a year to find the reaction rate of a rock called olivine. I plotted the time-series data using *Tableau* (they provide a free one year student license), made SVG figures using another tool (don't remember the name as of now).

## Abstract

The application of powdered silicate rock on land to absorb CO2 requires knowledge of the rate of the reaction and factors affecting it. Rate measured using mixed-flow reactors and batch reactors maybe be inaccurate for this purpose because of the low rock to volume ratio, pre-treatment of grains, and short run time. This work fulfills the gap by conducting batch-type column experiments with olivine over a long time 1 y. The results indicate the system has yet to achieve steady-state. The coarse grain-type have higher rate than fine-type and rates differ depending on the reaction product; these are several orders of magnitude smaller than past experiments. Surface-limited rate control or experimental errors cannot explain these results. A theoretical rate model for a packed bed of forsterite is used taking variables from the experiment. The similarity of model and experimental results indicate that the system is predominantly transport-controlled. The results might be relevant in understanding results from column experiments in general and the discrepancy between field and laboratory weathering rates.
